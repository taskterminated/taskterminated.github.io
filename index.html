        <p>Hi, my name is Victor Abakin. I have a background working in electronics at CRJ, 
a cable company based in Staten Island, where I developed hands-on technical skills 
working with cables and electronic systems. I am now looking to expand into the broader 
tech field and have recently started exploring software and web development. 
I enjoy working with technology and am excited to see where this new path takes me.</p>
